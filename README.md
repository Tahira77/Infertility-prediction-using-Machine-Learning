# Infertility Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Title:
**Infertility Prediction Using Lifestyle & PCOS Medical Data From Kerala Hospitals Using Machine Learning**

## 🩺 Domain:
Healthcare Data

---

## ❓ Problem Statement:
Infertility is a growing health concern among women globally. It’s often influenced by lifestyle, hormonal imbalance, and underlying medical conditions like PCOS.

Early detection and intervention can improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify the likelihood of infertility-related risks using patient lifestyle and clinical features.

We approach infertility prediction through the classification of PCOS presence — a major clinical indicator of infertility risk. Using patient health and lifestyle data, we train machine learning classifiers to identify patterns associated with infertility-prone individuals.

## 🎯 Objective:
To analyze and predict infertility risk using supervised machine learning algorithms based on patient demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data.

This model supports early detection of PCOS and other infertility markers through data-driven insights.

---

## ✅ Outcome:
- 🔍 A trained and evaluated machine learning model that predicts infertility risk.
- 📊 Insightful visualizations highlighting key contributing factors.
- ⚙️ A ready-to-use pipeline for data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling.
- 🏥 Potential for integration into digital health tools for early screening.

## 🗃️ Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of medical and lifestyle records of women, including hormone levels, BMI, cycle regularity, number of abortions, and insulin resistance markers. With over 500 entries, it contains both categorical and numerical variables.

### 🎯 Target:
**PCOS (Y/N)** — Indicates the presence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a common cause of infertility.

### 📌 Notes About the Data:
- Data contains 44 physical and clinical parameters.
- Collected from **10 hospitals across Kerala, India**.
- Height units converted from feet to cm.
- Blood pressure entered as systolic and diastolic values separately.
- RBS = Random Blood Sugar test.
- Beta-HCG cases are classified as Case I and Case II.
- Blood Group Codes:
  - A+ = 11, A- = 12, B+ = 13, B- = 14  
  - O+ = 15, O- = 16, AB+ = 17, AB- = 18
